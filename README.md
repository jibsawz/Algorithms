# Sorting Algorithms

*Hey there! Welcome to our repository. We’ve been having some fun writing sorting algorithms in JavaScript, and we’d love to share them with you. Sorting might sound fancy, but it’s basically just putting things in the right order, like tidying up your room! Here’s what we’ve got:*

1. **Insertion Sort**
2. **Bubble Sort**
3. **Selection Sort**
4. **Shell Sort**
5. **Heap Sort**
6. **Merge Sort**
7. **Quick Sort**



## Let’s Talk About the Algorithms

### 1. Insertion Sort
Imagine you’re sorting cards in your hand. You pick one card at a time and put it in the right place among the cards you’ve already sorted. Easy, right?

- **Example:** When you’re putting books on a shelf, you place each book where it fits by size.

### 2. Bubble Sort
This is like blowing bubbles! You keep comparing two bubbles next to each other, and if one is bigger, it floats up. You keep doing this until all the bubbles are in order.

- **Example:** Imagine sorting a row of kids by height. You compare two kids at a time and swap them if they’re in the wrong order.

### 3. Selection Sort
Think about picking the smallest item from a pile over and over. Once you find the smallest, you move it to a sorted pile and keep going.

- **Example:** Sorting your crayons by color, starting with the lightest.

### 4. Shell Sort
This is like Insertion Sort but smarter. Instead of comparing nearby items, you compare items far apart and slowly bring them closer together to sort.

- **Example:** When sorting a messy box of toys, you start by grouping similar ones (like cars and blocks) before putting them in exact order.

### 5. Heap Sort
Picture a neat stack of pancakes. You always take the biggest pancake from the stack, put it on your plate, and repeat until you have them all sorted.

- **Example:** Organizing a pile of plates by size, starting with the largest.

### 6. Merge Sort
You break things into tiny groups, sort each group, and then carefully put them back together in order. 

- **Example:** Organizing puzzle pieces by sorting small sections and then connecting them.

### 7. Quick Sort
This one’s clever! You pick one thing as the “boss” (pivot), then split everything into “smaller than the boss” and “bigger than the boss.” You keep doing this until it’s sorted.

- **Example:** Picking one toy as a reference and sorting the rest into “smaller” or “bigger” piles around it.
